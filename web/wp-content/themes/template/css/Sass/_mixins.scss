// Mixins
// It's alwas a good idea to create mixins. If u have code u need to repeat often, create a mixin!
// It's also faster to use and if u need change something, u got it on one place

// My mixin for flexing elements
@mixin flexing(
  $direction: row,
  $wrap: nowrap,
  $justify: flex-start,
  $align-items: stretch,
  $align-content: stretch
) {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: $direction;
  flex-wrap: $wrap;
  justify-content: $justify;
  align-items: $align-items;
  align-content: $align-content;
}
